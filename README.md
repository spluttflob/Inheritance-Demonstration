# Inheritance Demonstration
This repository holds some example classes that implement class inheritance.
This class heirarchy is artificial, made up, contrived, _etc._ for the purpose
of making a demonstration; these classes are not guaranteed or even suggested
to work for any particular purpose; they are provided only as an academic
example. Although this code is made freely available, it is provided without
any warranty of any kind, not even some implied or imagined warranty of
fitness for any particular purpose. 

Proper documentation for these classes is provided at 
https://spluttflob.github.io/Inheritance-Demonstration/.
